	test/gen_triangle_tests.py - Horribly put together tester.


Solving Logic:
	At any point if an exit condition is found then the proper message is
    printed and the execution ended.

	Check for 6 arguments handed to executable
	      	  ||
		  ||
		  \/
	Check that args are whole numbers within range
	      	  ||
		  ||
		  \/
	Compute distance between points squared (since using square root would
	garantee a whole number)
	          ||
		  ||
		  \/
	If the least distance squared is 0 then at least two points are the same
	          ||
		  ||
		  \/
	Test for collinearity using the equation located here:
	   http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Collinear.html
	          ||
		  ||
		  \/
	Compare the distance squared values computed above to determine if the
	triangle is equilateral (apparently that is impossible given our
	constraints), isosceles, or scalene.
		  ||
		  ||
		  \/
	Use the distance squared values in the equation a^2+b^2 = c^2. If equal
	the triangle is a right triangle, if c^2 is smaller then the triangle is
	acute, else the triangle is obtuse. c is defined as the longest side
	for my purposes.
