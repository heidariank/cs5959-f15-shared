Code review for Andrew Hendrix

~ will lineEqual work if the lines are the same but the endpoints are inverted?
  ~ e.g. line((1,2),(3,4)) ==? line((3,4),(1,2))

~ same with angleEqual, would it be possible for the same angle to have different left and right points?

~ is there any error checking to make sure the arguments are integers?

~ there should be '\n' after "right", "obtuse", "acute"

~ very thorough approach, i think some optimizations could eliminate some code
