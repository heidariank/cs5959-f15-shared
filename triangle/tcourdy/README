Triangle Classifier:

*Type 'make' to make the triangle executable.

*The triangle classifier takes 6 command line arguments which ultimately represent 3 points in coordinate space.

*The maximum allowed integer value is 1073741823 and the minimum is -1073741823

*To run the testing script type 'python testing_script.py' (This assumes you have python installed)

*The output of this program will match the following regex:
(((scalene|isosceles|equilateral) (acute|obtuse|right))|not a triangle|error)\n

*You will receive 'error' if you don't provide proper command line args.

*You will receive 'not a triangle' if the points you provide are colinear.

*The testing script will exit silently if you pass all tests.  The script will fail with a reason if you do not pass one of its tests.
