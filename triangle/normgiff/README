Homework 1

To run my code you can just use "make" and it will compile the code and 
run the tests. You can do this separately by enter "make gcc" or "make clang" 
and then running the tests by entering "make run_test". Enter make clean 
to remove the executable. Gcc is the default compiler.

I tried it on my computer and on the cade machin so I hope it will work
on your machine. I aso ran the script in bot bath and tcsh. Let me know if
you have any problems.
