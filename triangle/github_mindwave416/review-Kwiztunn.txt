-Needs sys.exit on incorrect input.
-I like the full separation of determining sides and angles into thir own helper methods very readable code
-Header file for predeclaration of methods also makes for readable code probably a better habbit than predeclaring in the c file.
-Good test cases on the border cases of overflow
