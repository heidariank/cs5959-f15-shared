Leland Stenquist Code Review of AJJohnson's code

General:

I am very impressed by your code it is very thourough.  
I like your use of Enums.
I also wish I had known the shoelace formula.  That was a great way to tell if the triangle is colinear.

Obviously you alread know this, but you should probably use a long long instead of a long. It will help you avoid overflow.
