-No test cases, max possible triangle, input out of range, letters, etc..

-More comments on the code would be helpful to determine whats going on

-I didnt notice a check for character input.

-also didnt see a chack for out of range inputs.

-Line 96 Im not sure but there may be rounding issues with the conversions from radians to degrees
