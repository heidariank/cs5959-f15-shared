-No test cases, max possible triangle, input out of range, letters, etc..

-More comments on the code would be helpful to determine whats going on

-I didnt notice if you were checking an input for characters or if the input was outside the given range (–(2^30 – 1) to (2^30 – 1)).

-Line 96 Im not sure but there may be rounding issues with the conversions from radians to degrees
