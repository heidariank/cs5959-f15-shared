-No test cases, max possible triangle, input out of range, letters, etc..

-More comments on the code would be helpful to determine whats going on

-Didnt see a check for input that checks for characters

-add check to make sure input is in the given range.

-Line 96 Im not sure but I think you might have some rounding issues with how you determine the angles.
